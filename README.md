# weather-dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to search for a city, find the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UVI index. It also provides you with your five day forecast. Another feature is it says your recent searches and allows you to click on them and have the information displayed. 

## Description
The first thing I did was set up the weather API. Then I had to create functions for my searched term to be passed through the current weather which was accessed by city name, and the five day forecast which was accessed by the latitude and longitude of the city. This is also how I found the UVI as that information was not provided by searching the city name. Then I had to access localStorage so the searched city terms were added to the recent searches list. Lastly, I had to create a function to pass the previous searches through the current weather and five day forecast upon clicking the city.
